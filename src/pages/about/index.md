### Community Building Impact

Our mission is to teach culture through a monthly culinary experience.

The evening agenda will be led by the facilitator, cultural intermediary and chef. The participants will be encouraged to ask questions to the chef and speaker to enhance their understanding and create an open dialogue.

By hosting these events we create an authentic opportunity to interact with the chef and view the food preparation. This allows for the participants to build community by sharing stories and food with people that they might not normally interact with or even know are a part of our diverse community in Cleveland.

We want to highlight that many cultures have a strong cultural connection to food and the time spent breaking bread with one another. Our goal is to tap in and leverage this commonality, to create a comfortable and traditional way to explore community and cultures.

Since we are focusing on creating a community that values diversity, it is important to create a shared experience around food - a universally important component of culture. We want to be much more than a monthly dinner club for Clevelanders with an international palate. To begin the experience, appetizers will be shared and passed as a medium to start connecting with others (even though they may be complete strangers) from diverse backgrounds. Participants will be encouraged to share food and dine “family style” to maximize the experience and taste new foods.
